# Code Review Notes

Project 1

Things I needed to fix.

    - Make the analyze method do all the code
    - Do the Academic Integrity to show who/what helped me
    - Place constructors at the top of the class for standards
    - Show the absolute path of the file instead of just the name
    - Test for empty tokens before sending to analyzers

Project 2

Things I needed to fix.

    - Add another method in FileAnalysis so there isn't a for loop inside
    another for loop
    - Move minimumTokenCount to the constructor
    - Move the empty parameter constructor to the top of the file in LargestTokenCount

Project 3

Things I needed to fix.
