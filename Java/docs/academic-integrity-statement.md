# Academic Integrity Statement

From the syllabus: "For each project, you are expected to include a list of the people with whom you have consulted (including students, IT guides, instructors, or anyone outside of our learning community) and resources used (including webpages and source code repositories, outside of our course learning materials) as part of your project. This information should be included in a file named academic-integrity-statement.md. If you did not use any outside resources, be sure to specify that in your document."

            - Hello everyone, I am working on Project 1 and I'm getting the error "FileAnalysis is not abstract and does not override abstract method generateOutputFile(String,String) in TokenAnalyzer".  Has anyone else run into this problem?  In the labs we haven't worked with abstract classes and methods so I'm not sure if we are supposed to try and use them or find another way.

            - I am receiving the following error when trying the "git status" command.  How do I go about to fix this?

            - I am trying to run the project to test for an output but I'm getting this error but I don't understand how the length is 0.

            - I am having trouble figuring out how to have the file written anywhere other than the projects directory.  How do I make the output path the output directory?

            - I am trying to run my code on the bigFile.txt and I've been told that it should take 3 - 15 seconds to execute, currently at a few minutes.  Where would I start to refactor to get that time frame down to within 15 seconds?

            - I'm having trouble leaving out all the empty tokens.  I am using an if statement to test whether or not the token is empty ( token = "") and that isn't doing the trick.  If it is an empty array, why isn't that line working?

            - How do you find the URI of the file?

        - I am getting this error in my constructor.  I have an argument for a properties and the error says it requires a parameter but in the project code provided, the this() is left empty.  Am I supposed to give it some kind of parameter or is there a different way?

        - This is my analyzer ArrayList being outputted to the command line,  are they supposed to look like this?

        - @Paula Waite I am testing out the bigFile.txt with my analzer and was wondering if you could tell me how many largest_words there are so I know if it's working correctly.

        - I messaged Joseph about an error I was receiving since he previously had the same error, was able to point me in the right direction

    - MATC lab
        - I spent a few hours for 3 days in the lab trying to complete the project,  I had help from about 4 different people to explain more deeply the
        errors that I was having and how to resolve them.

Project 4

Places I have received help from
    - Slack
        - I am getting the following error trying to grab an attribute. It says that Object can't be converted to EmployeeDirectory. which makes sense,
        but when I run the above code on the top, it says the className is EmployeeDirectory. So why does it have a problem trying to grab the
        attribute and assigning it to a variable with the type EmployeeDirectory?
